Hello everyone this is sakib and I am welcoming all of you on behalf of team horizon.This is our team and We are creating a System that can predict upcoming climate disaster using Machine Learning model and provide a communication network ranging from 12 to 120km using Mash Topology in Half duplex manner.
For the rapid change of climate we are facing new types of disasterous challenges.Lightning is one of them.Almost 8.6 million lightning strikes ground per day.The fatalities rate is 24000 person per year.Almost 1.5 billion worth of wealth is damage world wide.
Moving forward we have cyclone and flood.The annual cyclone fatalities are ranging from 10000 to 40000 peoples per year with 28 billion of wealth damage.On the other hand during flood this fatalities stood to 20000 to 80000 with 40 billion dollars worth of resources damage.Communication,Shelter and Alert Those three are the main cause of injuries and deaths from natural disasters.
So our main goal is to create a system to find solutions for the problem mentioned above.In this situation we are intoducing SDRAM or Sustainable Disaster Response Alert Mechanism.
The API we are using on our App  are Nasa's EONET,Google Floodhub and Tomorrow.io.We are Running A Machine Learning Model To Predict Lightning.The model we are using here is Support vector Machine.This trained model is going to clasify the real time earth data from tomorrow.io api for a specfic region and by the classfiction it will predict the probability of lightning in this region.Below you can see the dataset we are using.For flood and Cyclone we are using Nasa'S Eonet api and Google Floodhub.Here you can see our app ui and it's Functionality.The app is going to provide Realtime Location of Safehouse and Lightning Shelter pointed on the map and Send push notifications and sms as alert about the Prediction of Cyclone,Lightning & Flood.Here is the lightning arrester that we are going to use  to direct the electrical energy from a lightning strike safely into the ground.This lightning arrester is created by following all the rule from IEEE. It also can be designed with localy available resources.This are the electrical component that our hardware container is going to contain.We have node mcu as our logical unit , Lora sx1278 at 433mhz as communication module and High voltage transducer meter to calculate elevated DC and AC voltages during lightning events.This lightning information is going to stored in server.anyone can acess this information by the api we will provide for future use.Here you can our Response Mechanism.As we have said we are using Lora sx1278 as Response Mechanism.The lora is connected to our app by access point.Anyone want to send massege to the community he will pass the sms to the lora by his phone and anyone listening in this frequency will receive the sms and can communicate back in half duplex manner.Here is our System Flow of Hardware and Here is our System Flow of Mobile Apllication.Thanks for being with us.And here we have included the challenge we have met.Thank you.
